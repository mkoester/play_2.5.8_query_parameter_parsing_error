Reproducing an error in parsing query parameters
================================================

created a new Play Framework (2.5.8) project using activator. I just added very simple test cases using routes and my own Controller (TestController). parsing query parameters with a comma (,) are parsed incorrectly: the part after the comma is cut off. Using url encoded commas (%2C) on the other hand works:

- http://localhost:9000/test_option_string?stringOption=123%2C456,789 -> Some(123,456)
- http://localhost:9000/test_string?string=123%2C456,789              -> 123,456
- http://localhost:9000/test_string/123%2C456,789                     -> 123,456,789

a very similar problem is described in issue 6549: https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/6549
which should have been fixed with PR 6554: https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/6554
So either this is a different problem or the problem is not fixed with this PR


This is your new Play application
=================================

This file will be packaged with your application when using `activator dist`.

There are several demonstration files available in this template.

Controllers
===========

- HomeController.scala:

  Shows how to handle simple HTTP requests.

- AsyncController.scala:

  Shows how to do asynchronous programming when handling a request.

- CountController.scala:

  Shows how to inject a component into a controller and use the component when
  handling requests.

Components
==========

- Module.scala:

  Shows how to use Guice to bind all the components needed by your application.

- Counter.scala:

  An example of a component that contains state, in this case a simple counter.

- ApplicationTimer.scala:

  An example of a component that starts when the application starts and stops
  when the application stops.

Filters
=======

- Filters.scala:

  Creates the list of HTTP filters used by your application.

- ExampleFilter.scala

  A simple filter that adds a header to every response.
